Data Quality (Same for all models)
--------------
-The dataset contains missing values, as shown in RF_Data_Quality.csv, so the target 'worldwide' was coerced to numeric values only. Rows with missing
values were removed to avoid training on any invalid targets.
-A new feature run_time_minutes was created (numeric) whichwas derived from the run_time column.
-High cardinality text fields (IDs, names, free-text) were omitted to keep a compact feature set.
-Missing numeric inputs were imputed with the mean, and missing categorical inputs were filled with 'Unknown', then one-hot encoded.

Tuning Results
----------------
A mean baseline was used as a reference (same baseline model) Random Forest hyperparameters were tuned over:
n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf and max_features (as shown in RF_Tuning_Runs.csv)
