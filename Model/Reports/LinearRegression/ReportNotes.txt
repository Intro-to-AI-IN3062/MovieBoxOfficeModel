Data Quality
--------------
Some columns had missing values, so we handled them by filling them in with the mean of all the values in that column if they were numerical.
Our target column 'worldwide' had 7 missing values, so we simply dropped those rows and didn't impute them.
We also dropped domestic/international columns, since that would be considered leakage because the model wouldn't know those values prior to making a prediction.

Tuning Results
----------------
The mean baseline achieves near 0 R^2, which shows no predictive power beyond predicting the mean.
Linear Regression improves validation performance substantially (R^2 = 0.582, RMSE = 135.6M) The choice of hyperparameter fit_intercept has negligible impact, so we keep it set to True.
Validation R^2 is slightly higher than training R^2, suggesting no overfitting.
